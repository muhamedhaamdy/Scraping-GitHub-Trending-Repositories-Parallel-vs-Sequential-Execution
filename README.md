# GitHub Trending Repositories Scraper with Parallel Processing

This project is a Python application that scrapes the trending repositories on GitHub for multiple programming languages using parallel processing to optimize performance. The script fetches the daily trending repositories for languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Go, and presents them in an organized format.

## Key Features:
- Scrapes trending repositories from GitHub for various programming languages.
- Uses **BeautifulSoup** for web scraping to extract relevant data from GitHub's trending pages.
- Implements **parallel processing** with `ThreadPoolExecutor` to speed up the scraping process by handling multiple requests simultaneously.
- Optimized performance with a noticeable reduction in execution time compared to sequential scraping.
- Handles different HTTP responses and provides clear error messages when scraping fails.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The programming language used to write the application.
- **Requests**: Used for making HTTP requests to GitHub's trending repositories pages.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used for parsing HTML content and extracting relevant data.
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Used for parallel processing to scrape data for multiple languages simultaneously.

## How It Works:
1. The program sends HTTP requests to GitHub's trending repositories pages for multiple programming languages.
2. It scrapes the titles of the trending repositories and displays them in a user-friendly format.
3. The script leverages parallel processing to fetch data for multiple languages simultaneously, making the scraping process faster and more efficient.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-trending-repositories-scraper.git
